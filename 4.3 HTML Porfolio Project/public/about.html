<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Ricardo Grispos, born on the 2nd of July of 1997. 
  
  I am from Maputo, Mozambique a South East African country. I am a web developer and cyber security analyst. 
  Started dabling in computer science in 2017 went to a national college  in the United States to deepen my understanding
  learned most of skills to practical work like assignments and projects. I run my own WebDev Company where we design and develop for everyone.</p>

<p>Other than computer science, I have been playing guitar for 8 years and do play professionally for artists and projects.
  My favorite genres are RnB, Afro and Rock. But to my music taste diversity is something I don't lack. Each style is a new language
  or experience that can teach me more of what to enjoy and use in my playing time. I also train Mix Martial Arts, my focus is mainly in kickboxing, 
  however I am no stranger to grappling like Jiu Jitsu or Judo.
